To fix this, you need to ensure that all your third-party libraries are compatible with your current version of React Native.  You can do this by checking the library's documentation or by using a package manager like npm or yarn to install compatible versions.

Example (using npm):

First, check the documentation for `inconsistent-library` to find the compatible React Native version.
Let's assume a compatible version exists and is available as `inconsistent-library@2.0.0`. Then, update your `package.json` to specify the compatible version:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "inconsistent-library": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

Next, run:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install the updated version of the library that is compatible with your React Native version.

If no compatible version exists, you might need to consider upgrading or downgrading your React Native version to match the library's requirements. This is a more involved process and requires careful consideration of potential impacts on other parts of your application.
