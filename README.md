# React Native: Cryptic Errors from Inconsistent Third-Party Library Versions

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-debug issue in React Native: cryptic runtime errors caused by incompatibility between a project's React Native version and the versions of its third-party dependencies.

## The Problem

Using outdated or incompatible third-party libraries in React Native often leads to vague runtime errors that are challenging to trace back to their source. The root cause is often the mismatch between the library's required React Native version and the version used in the project.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component that imports a hypothetical library (`inconsistent-library`) designed for an older React Native version. Running this code will likely result in runtime errors that are not directly informative about the library's incompatibility.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution.  It involves checking the third-party library's documentation to identify its compatible React Native versions and then either updating the library to a compatible version or, if an update is not available, upgrading or downgrading the React Native version to match the library's requirements.  Dependency management tools (like npm or yarn) are essential for managing these versions effectively.  Also, reviewing the library's peerDependencies may identify additional compatibility concerns.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Try to run the app (this will likely fail).
4. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the resolution.
