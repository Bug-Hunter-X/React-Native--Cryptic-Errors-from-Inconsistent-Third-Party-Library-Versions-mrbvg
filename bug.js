This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that is not compatible with your current version of React Native.  For example, you might be using a library that is only compatible with React Native 0.60, but you are using React Native 0.65.  This can lead to various runtime errors, often without clear error messages.

Example:
```javascript
import InconsistentLibrary from 'inconsistent-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <InconsistentLibrary/>;
};
```
